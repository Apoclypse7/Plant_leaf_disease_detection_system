This repository contains the code and resources for a plant leaf disease detection system developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to accurately identify various diseases in plant leaves based on visual image analysis.

Key Features

1. CNN-based image classification: Employs a powerful CNN architecture to extract features and classify leaf images into different disease categories.
2. Training and evaluation: Includes code for training the model on a dataset of plant leaf images and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Potential for real-world applications: Has the potential to be integrated into mobile apps or web-based platforms for real-time disease detection in agricultural settings.
